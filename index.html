<p>Tornadoes are powerful, rapidly rotating columns of air that extend<br> from a thunderstorm to the ground.
 They typically appear as a funnel-shaped cloud extending downward from<br> the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, although not all tornadoes are visible<br> due to weather conditions or terrain.
 Tornadoes are one of the most violent and destructive<br> weather phenomena, capable of causing widespread devastation in a matter of minutes.</p><br>

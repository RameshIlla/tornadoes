<h1>HOW ARE TORNADOES CUASED?</h1>
<p style="background-color:sky blue" ; "font:italic">Tornadoes are caused by a combination of atmospheric conditions that create rotating air currents within severe thunderstorms. Here's a breakdown of the key factors involved:<br>

Moisture: Tornadoes typically form in environments where warm, moist air near the surface meets cooler, drier air aloft. This contrast in air masses creates instability in the atmosphere, which is crucial for the development of severe thunderstorms.<br>

Instability: Instability occurs when warm air near the surface is buoyant and prone to rising rapidly. As this warm, moist air rises, it cools and condenses, forming towering cumulonimbus clouds. The rapid upward motion of air within these clouds, known as updrafts, plays a significant role in tornado formation.<br>

Wind Shear: Wind shear refers to changes in wind speed and direction with height in the atmosphere. In environments with strong wind shear, horizontal winds can be oriented in such a way that they start spinning or rotating. This horizontal rotation can be stretched vertically by updrafts within a thunderstorm, leading to the formation of a rotating column of air, which is a precursor to a tornado.<br>

Updrafts and Downdrafts: Within a severe thunderstorm, powerful updrafts can tilt the rotating column of air from a horizontal to a vertical orientation. At the same time, downdrafts, or downward-moving air currents, can bring cooler air from higher altitudes to the surface. This process intensifies the rotation and can lead to the development of a tornado.<br>

Trigger Mechanisms: While the exact mechanisms that trigger the formation of tornadoes within severe thunderstorms are not fully understood, factors such as boundaries between air masses (such as cold fronts or dry lines), outflow boundaries from other storms, orographic lifting (air forced upward by terrain features), and other mesoscale features can enhance tornado development.<br>

It's important to note that while scientists have a good understanding of the atmospheric conditions conducive to tornado formation, predicting the exact time and location of tornadoes remains challenging. Meteorologists rely on radar, satellite imagery, atmospheric models, and ground observations to issue tornado warnings and provide guidance to the public.</p>

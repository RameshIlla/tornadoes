    <p style = "color:green" ; "font-style:italic">
      Safety precautions during a tornado are crucial to minimize the risk of injury or harm. Here are some key safety measures to follow:<br>
Stay Informed: Keep track of weather updates through a NOAA Weather Radio or local news broadcasts. Tornado watches and warnings are issued to inform people about possible tornado activity in their area.<br>
Have a Plan: Develop a tornado emergency plan for your household or workplace. Identify safe areas such as basements, storm shelters, or interior rooms on the lowest floor without windows.<br>
Practice Drills: Regularly practice tornado drills with your family or colleagues so everyone knows what to do in case of an emergency. Ensure everyone knows where to go and how to take cover quickly.<br>
Identify Shelter Locations: Know the location of designated tornado shelters in your community, such as public storm shelters or reinforced safe rooms.<br>
Seek Shelter: When a tornado warning is issued or if you observe threatening weather conditions, seek shelter immediately. Go to the lowest level of a sturdy building, preferably a basement, and take cover under a sturdy piece of furniture or use mattress cushions to protect yourself from flying debris.<br>
Avoid Windows: Stay away from windows, as they can shatter and cause serious injuries from flying glass.<br>
Protect Your Head: If possible, wear a helmet to protect your head from debris.<br>
Stay Inside: Do not try to outrun a tornado in a vehicle. Abandon cars and mobile homes for more substantial shelter.<br>
Monitor Weather Conditions: Keep monitoring weather conditions until the threat has passed. Tornadoes can produce multiple funnels or change direction suddenly.<br>
After the Storm: Wait for authorities to confirm that it is safe to emerge from shelter. Be cautious of downed power lines, debris, and other hazards when assessing damage or providing assistance to others.<br>
Remember, it's crucial to take tornado warnings seriously and act quickly to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you.</p>
